FOR MY SICK WEBSITE BABY

## UPDATE
* Hoping to go grid style for About page, will look very good for presenting stuff about me.
* Might take a while to learn though...

## UPDATE (2/19/21)
* Website is fully functional! Need to build the following things:
* Faster image loading times
* Moblie support
* Resume and Portfolio pages (template finished)
* Socials Links

## UPDATE (2/22/21)
* Began working on mobile support, still need to finish constructing the rest of the pages though
* In order to get faster image loading times, I would probably need better hosting. We will see.
* I can also look into getting a CDN for the images I wanna render.
